# snip-snap

A Visual Studio Code extension to insert any arbitrary snippet from the command palette!

Very useful if you want to:

- Control Visual Studio Code with another program (like voice recognition software!)
- While keeping the advantages of using snippets (ex. tabstops, choices)
- Without the hassle of defining them in VS Code and then sending arbitrary three letter codes from said program.

## Usage

There is one command accessible from the command palette `Insert Arbitrary Snippet` which you can assign to a keyboard shortcut.

Input any string following VS Code's [Snippet Syntax.](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_snippet-syntax)
